# SimClusterValidation

Tools to make interactive plots to visualize HGCAL reconstruction.

Relies on NanoHGCML ntuples. Instructions for generating these can be found [here](https://github.com/kdlong/production_tests)

To get started, take a look at the [example notebook](Visualization.ipynb)

An easy way to use the notebook is on the CERN [Swan service](https://swan.cern.ch/). You can clone this repo to your SWAN area in ```/eos/user/<first_letter>/<username>/SWAN_projects/``` and then open the previous file to start playing with this interactively.
